"""Base implementation of event loop.

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of IO events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.
