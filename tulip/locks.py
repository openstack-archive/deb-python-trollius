class Lock:
    """Primitive lock objects.

    A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned
    by a particular coroutine when locked.  A primitive lock is in one
    of two states, 'locked' or 'unlocked'.

    It is created in the unlocked state.  It has two basic methods,
    acquire() and release().  When the state is unlocked, acquire()
    changes the state to locked and returns immediately.  When the
    state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to release() in
    another coroutine changes it to unlocked, then the acquire() call
    resets it to locked and returns.  The release() method should only
    be called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked
    and returns immediately.  If an attempt is made to release an
    unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised.

    When more than one coroutine is blocked in acquire() waiting for
    the state to turn to unlocked, only one coroutine proceeds when a
    release() call resets the state to unlocked; first coroutine which
    is blocked in acquire() is being processed.

    acquire() is a coroutine and should be called with 'yield from'.

    Locks also support the context manager protocol.  '(yield from lock)'
    should be used as context manager expression.

    Usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        yield from lock
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            lock.release()

    Context manager usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        with (yield from lock):
             ...

    Lock objects can be tested for locking state:

        if not lock.locked():
           yield from lock
        else:
           # lock is acquired
           ...
