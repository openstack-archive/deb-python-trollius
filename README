Tulip is the codename for my attempt at understanding PEP-380 style
coroutines (i.e. those using generators and 'yield from').

For reference, see many threads in python-ideas@python.org started in
October 2012, especially those with "The async API of the Future" in
their subject, and the various spin-off threads.

A particularly influential tutorial by Greg Ewing:
