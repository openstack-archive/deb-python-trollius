Tulip is the codename for my attempt at understanding PEP-380 style
coroutines (i.e. those using generators and 'yield from').  

*** This requires Python 3.3 or later! ***

For reference, see many threads in python-ideas@python.org started in
October 2012, especially those with "The async API of the Future" in
their subject, and the various spin-off threads.

A particularly influential tutorial by Greg Ewing:
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/generators/yf_current/Examples/Scheduler/scheduler.txt

A message I posted with some explanation of the design:
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-October/017501.html

Essential files here (in top-to-bottom ordering):

- main.py: the main program for testing
- http_client.py: a rough HTTP/1.0 client
- sockets.py: transports for sockets and (client) SSL, and a buffering layer
- scheduling.py: a Task class and related stuff; this is where the PEP
  380 scheduler is implemented
- polling.py: an event loop and basic polling implementations for:
  select(), poll(), epoll(), kqueue()

Secondary files:

- .hgignore: files I don't care about
- Makefile: various quick shell commands
- README: this file
- TODO: longer list of TODO items and general thoughts
- http_server.py: enough of an HTTP server to point 'ab' at
- longlines.py: stupid style checker
- p3time.py: benchmark yield from vs. plain functions
- tulip_bench.py: yet another benchmark (like p3time.py and yyftime.py)
- xkcd.py: *synchronous* ssl example
- yyftime.py: benchmark yield from vs. yield <future>
