Tulip is the codename for my reference implementation of PEP 3156.

PEP 3156: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/

*** This requires Python 3.3 or later! ***

Master Mercurial repo: http://code.google.com/p/tulip/

The old code lives in the subdirectory 'old'; the new code (conforming
to PEP 3156, under construction) lives in the 'tulip' subdirectory.

To run tests:
  - make test

To run coverage (after installing coverage3, see below):
  - make coverage

To install coverage3 (coverage.py for Python 3), you need:
  - Distribute (http://packages.python.org/distribute/)
  - Coverage (http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/)
  What worked for me:
  - curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
  - python3 distribute_setup.py
  - <dowload and untar the coverage.py source distro>
  - cd coveragepy
  - python3 setup.py install
