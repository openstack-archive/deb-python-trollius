Tulip is the codename for my reference implementation of PEP 3156.

PEP 3156: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/

*** This requires Python 3.3 or later! ***

The old code lives in the subdirectory 'old'; the new code (conforming
to PEP 3156, under construction) lives in the 'tulip' subdirectory.

To run tests:
  - make test

To run coverage (coverage package is required):
