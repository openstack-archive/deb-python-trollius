Trollius is an experimental port of the Tulip project (asyncio module, PEP
3156) on Python 2.7.

* Website: https://bitbucket.org/haypo/trollius
* Tulip project: http://code.google.com/p/tulip/
* Copyright/license: Open source, Apache 2.0. Enjoy.

WARNING: Trollius code is in the "trollius" branch of the Mercurial repository,
not in the default branch (which is the Tulip project). Command to download
the development version of the source code (trollius branch):

    hg clone 'https://bitbucket.org/haypo/trollius#trollius'


Runtime Dependencies
====================

The futures project is needed on Python 2 to get a backport of
concurrent.futures.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures

Python 2.6 requires also ordereddict:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict


Test Dependencies
=================

Unit tests require the mock module:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock

Python 2.6 requires also unittest2:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2



Differences between Trollius and Tulip
======================================

* Trollius coroutines use "yield" and "raise Return(value)",
  whereas Tulip coroutines use "yield from" and "return".
* On Python 2.7, asyncio.SSLContext has less features than the ssl.SSLContext
  of Python 3.3: no options, verify_mode cannot be modified (fixed to
  CERT_NONE), no set_default_verify_paths() method, no SNI, etc. The SSL
  transport has "compression" extra info in Python 2.
* Lock syntax of Tulip "yield from lock" is not supported in
  Trollius. "yield lock.acquire() try: ... finally: lock.release()" should be
  used instead
* Python 2 does not support keyword-only parameters.
* If the concurrent.futures module is missing, BaseEventLoop.run_in_executor()
  uses a synchronous executor instead of a pool of threads. It blocks until the
  function returns, and so DNS resolutions are blocking.


Usage
=====

The actual code lives in the 'asyncio' subdirectory.
Tests are in the 'tests' subdirectory.

To run tests:
  - make test

To run coverage (coverage package is required):
  - make coverage

On Windows, things are a little more complicated.  Assume 'P' is your
Python binary (for example C:\Python33\python.exe).

You must first build the _overlapped.pyd extension and have it placed
in the asyncio directory, as follows:

    C> P setup.py build_ext --inplace

Then you can run the tests as follows:

    C> P runtests.py

And coverage as follows:

    C> P runtests.py --coverage

Trollius name
=============

Extract of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollius :

Trollius is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the family Ranunculaceae,
closely related to Ranunculus. The common name of some species is globeflower
or globe flower. Native to the cool temperate regions of the Northern
Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity of species in Asia, trollius usually
grow in heavy, wet clay soils.


Change log
==========

Development version

- SSL support is now optional: don't fail if the ssl module is missing

2014-01-08: version 0.1.2

- Trollius now supports CPython 2.6-3.4, PyPy and Windows. All unit tests
  pass with CPython 2.7 on Linux.
- Fix Windows support. Fix compilation of the _overlapped module and add a
  asyncio._winapi module (written in pure Python). Patch written by Marc
  Schlaich.
- Support Python 2.6: require an extra dependency,
  ordereddict (and unittest2 for unit tests)
- Support Python 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4
- Support PyPy 2.2
- Don't modify __builtins__ nor the ssl module to inject backported exceptions
  like BlockingIOError or SSLWantReadError. Exceptions are available in the
  asyncio module, ex: asyncio.BlockingIOError.

2014-01-06: version 0.1.1

- Fix asyncio.time_monotonic on Mac OS X
- Fix create_connection(ssl=True)
- Don't export backported SSLContext in the ssl module anymore to not confuse
  libraries testing hasattr(ssl, "SSLContext")
- Relax dependency on the backported concurrent.futures module: use a
  synchronous executor if the module is missing

2014-01-04: version 0.1

- First public release
